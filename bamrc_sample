## SOURCES
# List each source starting with the word 'source'. Then list an alias for the
# source and the path to the source. The alias is used later in the profile.
# Then list any subpaths that should be ignored one per line preceeded by an
# 'i'. These should be in the rsync exclude format.
# Also list each path that should be collapsed. These are synced but the output
# log only shows them as one entry to help with readability. These are
# especially useful for system folders that contain a lot of files.
# List one path per line preceeded by a 'c'.
# Regular shell type wildcards allowed. Should contain at least one wildcard
# (otherwise, what are you trying to collapse).

## PROFILES
# A profile is identified by the destination root to which the source files are
# being mirrored. Each profile contains a mapping from the source folders to
# destination folders within the destination root.
# Specify one mapping per line preceeded by a plus sign.
# Each destination folder should be relative to the destination root.
